The shared dependencies between the files we are generating are:

1. **Package.json**: This file contains the list of dependencies and scripts for the Next.js application. All other files indirectly depend on this as it manages the packages used throughout the application.

2. **tsconfig.json**: This file contains the configuration for TypeScript. All TypeScript files (.tsx) share this configuration.

3. **.next/config.js**: This file contains the configuration for the Next.js application. All pages and components in the application share this configuration.

4. **pages/index.tsx, pages/_app.tsx, pages/_document.tsx**: These are the main pages of the Next.js application. They share common Next.js APIs like `getInitialProps` or `getServerSideProps` for server-side rendering. They also share common React components like `<Head>`, `<Main>`, and `<NextScript>`.

5. **components/Header.tsx, components/Footer.tsx**: These are common components used in the pages of the application. They might share common props, state, and React hooks.

6. **styles/globals.css, styles/Home.module.css**: These are the stylesheets for the application. They share common CSS classes and IDs.

7. **public/favicon.ico, public/vercel.svg**: These are static files served by the Next.js application. They don't have shared dependencies with other files but are used in the pages and components of the application.

8. **Function Names**: Functions like `getInitialProps`, `getServerSideProps`, and React component functions are shared across multiple files.

9. **Exported Variables**: Variables exported from one module could be used in another. For example, a component exported from a file in the components directory could be used in a page file.

10. **DOM Element IDs**: If any JavaScript function uses a DOM element, the ID of that element would be a shared dependency. For example, if a function in a page file manipulates a DOM element in a component file, the ID of that element would be a shared dependency.

11. **Message Names**: If the application uses a messaging system (like events or Redux actions), the names of the messages would be shared dependencies.
